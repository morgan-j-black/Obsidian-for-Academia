How I get citations from [[Zotero]]. There is another plugin, but this one is simpler as it just looks for a library.bib file.

Again, this is made easier by using a template in the [[Citations]] settings.

From then on, you can just use them like normal [[Obsidian - wiki link]], but with an "@" at the front to distinguish the notes. They will be kept in `Literature Notes/`

Turns out I made some scripts to help link the doi or url.

Oh, how did this citation get here... [[@Laker2021a]]

As you can see, there are links to take you directly to the paper or its entry in [[Zotero]]
