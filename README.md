# Obsidian-for-Academia
Demo vault to explain how to use Obsidian, git and Zotero

The point of making the tutorial inside Obsidian is to **show**, rather than tell, you how it works. Therefore, this vault comes with some plugins and templates pre-installed.

This hopefully gives you a good base to try out Obsidian and see if you like it.

# Installation

Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and download this repository.

Inside Obsidian, "open folder as vault" which should open up the start page (Notes/Obsidian). If not then open this file and the tutorial will continue from there.

> To allow third party plugins, you will need to go into settings and enable community plugins (Settings > Community plugins)

# How it works

Obsidian is a note taking app, where essentially you are just editing text files with a few extra bells and whistles. The **key** is that you can link notes together with simple wiki link (they look like [[this]]). This allows structure to form as you write down ideas, so you don't need to create a complex folder structure.

By linking these ideas together, structure can naturally form that matches your way of thinking. You also get a cool graph like this:
