# Obsidian-for-Academia
Demo vault to explain how to use Obsidian, git and Zotero

The point of making the tutorial inside Obsidian is to show you how it works. Therefore, this vault comes with some plugins and templates pre-installed.

# Installation

Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and download this repository.

Inside Obsidian, "open folder as vault" which should open up the start page (Notes/Obsidian). If not then open this file and the tutorial will continue from there.

> To allow third party plugins, you will need to go into settings and enable community plugins (Settings > Community plugins)
