[[Obsidian]] is a note taking app, where essentially you are just editing text files with a few extra bells and whistles. This is a different approach to some apps like [[Notion]], where everything is online and you don't actually have your own data locally. So, if you plan to make a [[second brain]] (or just note take) then you don't want to have to rely on a company to store your data.

# Markdown

So [[Obsidian]] just lets you edit text files using the [[Markdown]] language.

To see the raw code go into "source mode". I usually keep it how it is in "live editor"

[[Obsidian]] has a few extras such as callouts:

You can add pictures by just pasting them in, this will automatically put the image in the attachments folder and link it here. If you want to clear unused images, then use the "clear unused images" command from [[Obsidian - command palette]].

The most important feature that sets [[Obsidian]] apart is [[wilki links]].

# Wiki links

These are how [[Obsidian]] links notes together, and is a quick way to build up a graph of all your connections.

> [!important] 
> If you hold `ctrl` and hover over a link it will show the note in a little window. So you can look up a concept without leaving your note

You can create these as you type [[like this]] even if no file exists. When you feel like that concept has been mentioned enough, then hold `ctrl` and press on the link which will create the file.

If you change the file name, it will automtically update all the links in your [[Vault]].

Link to a certain part of a file with a # after the file name like [[Obsidian#Useful keyboard shortcuts]]

Link to a block of text with the ^ like [[Obsidian#^82dbb8]]

You can embed a file inside another by using ! before the [[wilki links|wiki link]] like this ![[Obsidian#Useful keyboard shortcuts]]
Which is how pictures are shown ![[th-390968233.jpg]]

You can also link to an image without downloading ![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Dctg6F6CYvLoasIBLe4TvAHaCe%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=d0ae2db9a6defd58fd5fd3e86320503662c405f523be54c53c4d99eef25c10bc&ipo=images)

> [!important] 
> These links are the main way to traverse your notes. This means that you don't have to worry about a folder structure where notes can get lost. If you use [[wilki links]] you can always search for the backlinks

Using [[Obsidian]] this way means that you can flick back and forth between notes if you get a random thought. I just remembered that you can change the note text by using a | after the filename [[wiki links|like this]].

# Useful keyboard shortcuts

- Open file with `ctrl+o`
- Close file with `ctrl+w`
- Get the [[Obsidian - command palette]] with `ctrl+p`

# Plugins
At its simplest [[Obsidian]] is just note taking, but it can become more with plugins. These are written by third-parties (who are usually just enthusiatic [[Obsidian]] users). 

> [!info] 
> You need to enable "community plugins" by leaving safe mode in the settings.

I have included the plugins I use most frequently use, which are:
- [[Calendar plugin]]
- [[Citations]]
- [[Clear unused images]]
- [[Excalidraw]]
- [[Latex suite]]
- [[Media extended]]
- [[Natural Language Dates]]
- [[Obsidian git]]
- [[Tasks]]
- [[Templater]]

Try Dataview when you want to do something fancy...

# Tags

You can also use tags like #project

which is useful for working on projects as you can make  query block

```query
#project 
```

# People

I like to use notes to keep track of who suggested an idea.

Can also be useful in a conference to keep track of who someone is and what they work on.

# Beware the rabbit hole

This setup took me quite a while to make, and involved a deep dive in the rabbit hole. [[Obsidian]] is always changing and there are so many plugins its hard to keep up.
