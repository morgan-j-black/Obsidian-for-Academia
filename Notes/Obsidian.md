[[Obsidian]] is a note taking app, where essentially you are just editing text files with a few extra bells and whistles. This is a different approach to some apps like [[Notion]], where everything is online and you don't actually have your own data locally. Therefore, if you plan to take notes for a long time you don't really want to rely on a company to store your data.

> [!important] 
> If the company behind [[Obsidian]] ever went down then you would still just have all your notes on your computer. They are just text files so could be imported into a new app

> [!tip] 
> There is another similar app called [[logseq]], which actually has a really nice [guide](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/start%20here) to why this type of note taking may be better for you

# Tips

I like to use notes to keep track of who suggested an idea. This can also be useful in a conference to keep track of who someone is and what they work on.

# Beware the rabbit hole

This setup took me quite a while to make, and involved a deep dive in the rabbit hole. [[Obsidian]] is always changing and there are so many [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugins]] its hard to keep up.

> [!info] 
> Try out this setup and tweak it to suit you. Usually these changes can be made in the settings for each [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugin]], or go on the obsidian forums

> [!tip] 
> If you think of a good idea, someone has probably made a plugin for it
