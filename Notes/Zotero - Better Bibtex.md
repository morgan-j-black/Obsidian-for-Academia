> This is a way to constantly update a `.bib` file

So, to use the [[Citations]] [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugin]] with [[Obsidian]] you should make [[Zotero - Better Bibtex]] automatically export a `.bib` file into this vault.

> There is sometimes a delay with this after adding new citations to [[Zotero]]. If you want to force it, then go into `edit>preferences>Better Bibtex>Automatic Export>Export now`
